# Atmospheric Scattering

This is an algorithm for calculating the color of the sky in python. It takes into account both Rayleigh and Mie scattering. 
The code is subdivided in three chunks:
- Classes.py: Where the vector class with vector properties that will be useful throughout the code is implemented
- Algorithm.py: Where the algorithm that we will be using for calculating the color of one pixel is implemented
- Results.py: Where the image creation takes place
